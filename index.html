    <h1>Environmental Metabolic Risk Assessment Tool (EMRAT)</h1>
    
    <p>
    This platform provides a structured assessment tool designed to help dietitians evaluate environmental factors influencing metabolic regulation and guide personalized preventive strategies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This assessment does not provide a medical diagnosis. It evaluates environmental exposure associated with metabolic stress.
